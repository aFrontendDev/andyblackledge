                    I'm a front end developer currently working at <a href="http://www.building-blocks.com" rel="external">Building Blocks</a> where I've been since April 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started out here as a junior dev on the service desk and then moved onto the front end team in September 2013, I'm now a senior member of this team and am lead FE dev on the projects I work on. Builidng Blocks tends to work with large international organisations so the projects I work on will normally be large site builds (as opposed to only building a microsite or landing page) starting from scratch with new designs provided to us and generally I have quite a lot of freedom in the build process (although everything does have to work as part of a CMS).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been working in the industry since June 2011 so the vast majority of my career to date has been with Building Blocks, prior to this I worked at a very small agency called "Gold Search Media" which is no longer around (pretty sure that's unrelated to me working there though...).

                    In front end dev there's a ridiculous amount of tools and frameworks etc, available to use in order to build sites and there are new things being created all the time. I have my favourites like everyone else and I try to keep up to date with the latest trends, I've listed below what I use regularly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My preferred approach to building is to create things in a very modular fashion rather than on a page basis, this our standard way to build at Building Blocks and it's very useful when building for a CMS. This is reflected in my class naming (e.g. .promo .promo-style-a), I find this way of naming helps me to really break down what a component/module is rather than what it's being used for in the context of one particular design.
