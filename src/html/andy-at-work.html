                                      <p>
                                          My role is as a front end developer and has been for the past 2 and a half years (as of April 2016), at this point in my career with Building Blocks I lead the front end on the projects I work on, responsible for any and all front end decisions on my projects.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I am a mentor to our only junior FE dev and often help out the other FE devs on the team. We have a team of 5 including myself but no real heirarchy in the team (no senior or head titles) so make decisions on what direction to take our FE template (now a pvt repo but the older/out of date public repo is here - <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website">https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website</a>) as a team with myself and another more senior member of the team making sure we still build in a 'Building Blocks way'. I also facilitate monthly FE team meetings so that we can all catchup on how our work is going, deal with any issues that there may be and so that we can share potential improvements to the way we work.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          As a more senior member of the FE team I will often be approached to estimate projects, offer advice on client requests, take part in workshops with the clients, take part in meetings around the company culture, general project direction, etc. I've also had the good fortune to take part in meetings with clients and design agencies in London, Orlando and Amsterdam on a couple of occassions and have just helped in the transition of our code base (due to project completion) over to the client and to help the backend team at IBM with the integration of our code.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          So although my day to day job is FE dev I do have a wider role within the company which has allowed me to develop my career and certainly keeps me more than a little bit busy.
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>What technologies do I work with, what platforms do I know?</h5>
                                  </header>
                                  <div class="article-body">
                                      <p>
                                          I don't want to just write down a list of buzzwords but I do feel like I need to outline what I know somehow so I'll be brief and try to avoid sounding like a job posting.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I learnt front end at Building Blocks from some very clever people who have since moved on, what they left was a great foundation to build from and work with. Whilst this is a fantastic position to be in, the drawback in a sense, is that I only really know the Building Blocks way. What this means is that there will probably be a little learning curve for me when I eventually leave BB for another work place (nobody stays in one place forever of course), this doesn't worry me in the slightest but could make me less attractive to potential employers (possibly?).
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>So how do I work?</h5>
                                      <p>
                                          As already mentioned previously there is a older version of our template <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website">online</a> which will demonstrate very quickly how I work.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          We use <strong>Grunt</strong> as our build tool, use <strong>less</strong> to write our css (I've also used <strong>sass</strong> myself, <a href="https://github.com/grumpydev22/andyblackledge/tree/master/src/assets/styles/sass">my repo</a>), our html is created in a very modular fashion with the help of <strong>Handlebars</strong> with <strong>Assemble</strong>. JS is written also in a very modular fashion with the help of <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub">pubsub</a>, we include jQuery as standard in our projects and it is jQuery that I use as opposed to writing vanilla JS.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I have tried to wean myself off jQuery (this site doesn't use jQuery) because as I progress I would like to be more of a front end <strong>developer</strong>, working on more JS orientated projects and less on the visual aspects so clearly I need to improve my vanilla JS to do this.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          So why don't I just stop using jQuery? At the risk of sounding like I'm making excuses, the deadlines for our projects are pretty tight and I can't afford to let a project run behind just for a personal reason.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          What I have done is write any functionality for this site in vanilla JS which was an interesting learning exercise and I can't wait to find another personal project to take this further.
                                      </p>

                                          Anyone who has any involement in front end will know there's a new framework or build tool coming out every week and there's always someone writing a blog post or doing a talk about it the week after it's out. I haven't mentioned any of them in my previous section, why not???
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I don't like to jump on the latest thing and start using it without reason to, I don't have enough time to play around with everything that comes out and when I do play with something it's in little bits a pieces over a couple weeks, such is life.
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>So you're not staying up to date?</h5>
                                      <p>
                                          Depends on your definition and what's important to you. As mentioned I do play around when I can, recently I've set up a node environment on an AWS server (Amazon lets you pay for the traffic/usage so it's really cheap :D), I've played around with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> which is really cool if you're not aware of it, sort of a backend/database as a service platform from (acquired by) Google. To learn a bit about Firebase I wanted to make a calendar application for a group of people to be able to select days they were free (if you were trying to find a suitable date for a group night out for example). I made all the JS functionality but never got round to styling it so the functionality is there but it needs the UI to be made (<a href="https://github.com/grumpydev22/calendar">my repo</a>).
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I've also previously played around with Angular, working through Tutorials. I've also started to look at Angular 2 with Typescript as I'd like to learn how to write in Typescript for a more object oriented approach (so those backend devs will take us more seriously!) and I'd love to know and be able to build with Angular as I like the concept of single page sites, especially as that might lead to more functional pieces of work for me.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I plan to build a blog for my site using Angular 2 and a node server to query and write JSON files instead of using a php or .net backend. I have no interest in writing a blog, I just want to create the platform as a learning exercise.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          Within work I also had some time for a bit of a side project with a colleague, we wanted to take the standard BB FE template and convert it from Handlebars to Razor for closer collaboration and better integration with the backend as they use Razor templates currently and it's so similar to Handlebars. So with some googling and playing around we managed to create something which works in the same way as the current system but with Razor, something we were both really happy with and can't wait for an opportunity to use it on a live project - <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website-razor">Razor template</a>.
                                      </p>

                                          Manchester is a great place to be a front end dev at the minute I think, there a few different talks/meetups that take place regularly and there's now at least one big FE conference a year (upFrontConf) as well as a number of general digital events (digital BBQ for example). I have to hold my hands up and admit I don't take advantage of this as much as I should, I've attended the 2 upFrontConf events that took place last year (2015) and I've been to a number of MCR Fred meetups and attended last years digital BBQ. The digital BBQ probably isn't quite my kind of thing, seemed more of a networking event, so it's probably great if you're a freelancer but networking isn't a <strong>strong</strong> suit for me, a couple 'free' drinks and a bit of bbq food is always good though!
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I have my ticket for this years upFrontConf which I'm very much looking forward to, I enjoy listening to talks and find myself enthused afterwards and there's been some great talks at MCR Fred that are still useful and relevant now (got to see Bruce Lawson from Opera give a talk at MCR Fred!). <small>*Note to self, considering you like these talks you should probably attend more!</small>
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          To stay up to date I follow a lot of FE related people on Twitter which I find to be a great resource for interesting blog posts and talks. I also subscribe to a couple of FE newsletters which tend to be very useful and of course I've got my own little community of developers, people I've worked with past and present and by staying in touch with freelancers that I've worked with at BB. I'm in a couple of slack channels with these guys which mean we can all help each other out, learn from each other and share articles and videos of talks. Might not sound like much but it's very useful to me.
