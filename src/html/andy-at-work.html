                                      <p>
                                          My role is as a front end developer and has been for the past 2 and a half years (as of April 2016), at this point in my career with Building Blocks I lead the front end on the projects I work on, responsible for any and all front end decisions on my projects.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I am a mentor to our only junior FE dev and often help out the other FE devs on the team. We have a team of 5 including myself but no real hierarchy in the team (no senior or head titles) so make decisions on what direction to take our FE template (now a pvt repo but the older/out of date public repo is here - <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website">https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website</a>) as a team with myself and another more senior member of the team making sure we still build in a 'Building Blocks way'. I also facilitate monthly FE team meetings so that we can all catchup on how our work is going, deal with any issues that there may be and so that we can share potential improvements to the way we work.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          As a more senior member of the FE team I will often be approached to estimate projects, offer advice on client requests, take part in workshops with the clients, take part in meetings around the company culture, general project direction, etc. I've also had the good fortune to take part in meetings with clients and design agencies in London, Orlando and Amsterdam on a couple of occasions and have just helped in the transition of our code base (due to project completion) over to the client and to help the backend team at IBM with the integration of our code.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          So although my day to day job is FE dev I do have a wider role within the company which has allowed me to develop my career and certainly keeps me more than a little bit busy.
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>What technologies do I work with, what platforms do I know?</h5>
                                  </header>
                                  <div class="article-body">
                                      <p>
                                          I don't want to just write down a list of buzzwords but I do feel like I need to outline what I know somehow so I'll be brief and try to avoid sounding like a job posting.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I learnt front end at Building Blocks from some very clever people who have since moved on, what they left was a great foundation to build from and work with. Whilst this is a fantastic position to be in, the drawback in a sense, is that I only really know the Building Blocks way. What this means is that there will probably be a little learning curve for me when I eventually leave BB for another work place (nobody stays in one place forever of course), this doesn't worry me in the slightest but could make me less attractive to potential employers (possibly?).
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>So how do I work?</h5>
                                      <p>
                                          As already mentioned previously there is a older version of our template <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website">online</a> which will demonstrate very quickly how I work.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          We use <strong>Grunt</strong> as our build tool, use <strong>less</strong> to write our css (I've also used <strong>sass</strong> myself, <a href="https://github.com/grumpydev22/andyblackledge/tree/master/src/assets/styles/sass">my repo</a>), our html is created in a very modular fashion with the help of <strong>Handlebars</strong> with <strong>Assemble</strong>. JS is written also in a very modular fashion with the help of <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub">pubsub</a>, we include jQuery as standard in our projects and it is jQuery that I use as opposed to writing vanilla JS.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I have tried to wean myself off jQuery (this site doesn't use jQuery) because as I progress I would like to be more of a front end <strong>developer</strong>, working on more JS orientated projects and less on the visual aspects so clearly I need to improve my vanilla JS to do this.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          So why don't I just stop using jQuery? At the risk of sounding like I'm making excuses, the deadlines for our projects are pretty tight and I can't afford to let a project run behind just for a personal reason.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          What I have done is write any functionality for this site in vanilla JS which was an interesting learning exercise and I can't wait to find another personal project to take this further.
                                      </p>

                                          Anyone who has any involvement in front end will know there's a new framework or build tool coming out every week and there's always someone writing a blog post or doing a talk about it the week after it's out. I haven't mentioned any of them in my previous section, why not???
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I don't like to jump on the latest thing and start using it without reason to, I don't have enough time to play around with everything that comes out and when I do play with something it's in little bits a pieces over a couple weeks, such is life.
                                      </p>

                                      <h5>So you're not staying up to date?</h5>
                                      <p>
                                          Depends on your definition and what's important to you. As mentioned I do play around when I can, recently I've set up a node environment on an AWS server (Amazon lets you pay for the traffic/usage so it's really cheap :D), I've played around with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> which is really cool if you're not aware of it, sort of a backend/database as a service platform from (acquired by) Google. To learn a bit about Firebase I wanted to make a calendar application for a group of people to be able to select days they were free (if you were trying to find a suitable date for a group night out for example). I made all the JS functionality but never got round to styling it so the functionality is there but it needs the UI to be made (<a href="https://github.com/grumpydev22/calendar">my repo</a>).
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I've also previously played around with Angular, working through Tutorials. I've also started to look at Angular 2 with Typescript as I'd like to learn how to write in Typescript for a more object oriented approach (so those backend devs will take us more seriously!) and I'd love to know and be able to build with Angular as I like the concept of single page sites, especially as that might lead to more functional pieces of work for me.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I plan to build a blog for my site using Angular 2 and a node server to query and write JSON files instead of using a php or .net backend. I have no interest in writing a blog, I just want to create the platform as a learning exercise.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          Within work I also had some time for a bit of a side project with a colleague, we wanted to take the standard BB FE template and convert it from Handlebars to Razor for closer collaboration and better integration with the backend as they use Razor templates currently and it's so similar to Handlebars. So with some googling and playing around we managed to create something which works in the same way as the current system but with Razor, something we were both really happy with and can't wait for an opportunity to use it on a live project - <a href="https://github.com/buildingblocks/bb-prototype-website-razor">Razor template</a>.
                                      </p>

                                          Manchester is a great place to be a front end dev at the minute I think, there a few different talks/meetups that take place regularly and there's now at least one big FE conference a year (upFrontConf) as well as a number of general digital events (digital BBQ for example). I have to hold my hands up and admit I don't take advantage of this as much as I should, I've attended the 2 upFrontConf events that took place last year (2015) and I've been to a number of MCR Fred meetups and attended last years digital BBQ. The digital BBQ probably isn't quite my kind of thing, seemed more of a networking event, so it's probably great if you're a freelancer but networking isn't a <strong>strong</strong> suit for me, a couple 'free' drinks and a bit of bbq food is always good though!
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                          I have my ticket for this years upFrontConf which I'm very much looking forward to, I enjoy listening to talks and find myself enthused afterwards and there's been some great talks at MCR Fred that are still useful and relevant now (got to see Bruce Lawson from Opera give a talk at MCR Fred!). <small>*Note to self, considering you like these talks you should probably attend more!</small>

                                      <p>
                                          To stay up to date I follow a lot of FE related people on Twitter which I find to be a great resource for interesting blog posts and talks. I also subscribe to a couple of FE newsletters which tend to be very useful and of course I've got my own little community of developers, people I've worked with past and present and by staying in touch with freelancers that I've worked with at BB. I'm in a couple of slack channels with these guys which mean we can all help each other out, learn from each other and share articles and videos of talks. Might not sound like much but it's very useful to me.
                                      </p>

                                          I'm not going to discuss everything in detail because the majority of my work history is going to be irrelevant to this industry as you'll soon find out and as I'm currently 32 (4th July 1983) there's plenty of jobs in my past!

                                              April 2012
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Started as a junior developer on the service desk, here I spent my time working through support tickets from our clients, mainly on a couple of clients that I was assigned to. These tickets were usually small bugs or improvements that required working with a CMS called Tridion and working in a .net c# environment.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              At this time I didn't really know much .net (and still don't) so I had to learn as I went. There wasn't a whole lot of front end work but as I progressed I had more of the front end tasks assigned to me as that became my strongest area and something I enjoyed more.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Working on the service desk is pretty challenging and helped me develop my debugging skills greatly. I made it clear that I wanted to join the front end team after a while here and I was eventually (after 18months) moved off service desk and moved into the front end team
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              I've now been on the front end team since September 2013 and over this time have become more and more central to that team and have been the lead front end dev on projects for a while now.

                                              </strong>
                                              June 2011
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              This was my first job in the industry straight off the back of my HND in web development. It was a small agency in Manchester working with small to medium businesses around the country, building sites for driving instructors up to companies working in the solar panel and construction industry which were obviously turning over a lot more money.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              The sites we built were just small static sites, occasionally we'd have to build something in wordpress but mostly just html pages with no back end at all.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              At this time I was just writing html, css and using javascript plugins, at this point I didn't really know any JS at all and this was just prior to responsive sites becoming the norm and before less and sass had become widely used. So very basic but a good start in the industry, a world away from what I do now.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Unfortunately this company ran into financial difficulties and I was made redundant, they no longer exist as a business I'm sad to say. Luckily for me I secured a position at Building Blocks and it's been the making of my career to this point, so ultimately it worked out well for me.

                                          <p>
                                              Before I got into the industry I'd had a number of jobs in customer service and sales and completed two courses at university, I really didn't know what I was doing and what direction to go in.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Out of college (2001) I worked in a call centre for the mobile network O2, I wouldn't recommend call centre work, destroys the soul.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              In my desperate attempt to find a career I almost joined the Army! I went through the whole selection process and was offered a position in the Royal Signals, after much deliberation I decided this wouldn't be the best route for me after all (thank god! Don't think I would've thrived in this environment).
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              So onto another job, DRL, another call centre, again, not for me, didn't enjoy the work, the company itself was fine but this type of work just wasn't right for me.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Time for another job! This time as a sales person at an appliance store called Miller Brothers, a bit like Comet or Currys. This was up and down for me but ultimately I'm not a sales person, it's just not in me and I don't think I have the personality type for this profession.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              I know! I'll go to uni! So off to the University of Bolton (<a href="http://www.bolton.ac.uk/Home.aspx">yes it's a real place</a>) where I studied and acquired a degree in Psychology. Great subject, very interesting, I recommend it as a subject to learn but probably not the best in terms of job prospects...
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              Well I have a degree now, have to leave uni, guess I'll find a full time job again, off to Alliance and Leicester (now Santander). Here I worked behind the cash desk and then moved on to become a 'personal advisor' helping people by setting up bank accounts, applying for loans and credit cards for people and setting up and recommending savings accounts.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              The bank was ok but I joined in 2008, just as the 'credit crunch' (aka the huge recession) kicked in, not really a good time to work in a bank. I also didn't find the work particularly fulfilling, it also involved sales which I didn't know when I joined, so again not a good role for me.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              So fast forward a year, working in a bank in a job I don't enjoy and as such I don't have much in the way of career options. There had to be more to life!
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              I started to really think about what I enjoyed and what I could potentially do for work in the areas I enjoy. I liked computers, maybe I could do something in IT? I again turned to the University of Bolton to see what courses I could do, web development seemed like the most interesting so I'd signed up for a HND in 'multimedia and web development'.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                              I started my HND in September 2009 and went part time at the bank, I finished my course in June 2011 and found a job the same week that I took my last exam and now all these years later I'm a .com millionaire, well, not quite but at least I finally do something I enjoy and that I'm good at. Happy days!
